            "text": "First International Workshop on Mobile and Pervasive Internet of Things (PerIoT 2017)\n\n\n(co-located with \nIEEE PerCom 2017\n)\n\n\nMarch 13 - 17, Kona, Big Island, Hawaii, USA\n\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of modern wireless telecommunications. The IoT enables large numbers of previously unconnected devices to communicate and exchange data and deal with services that span areas from healthcare to transportation and much more, with the potential for significant benefits to people and quality of life. The IoT would also enable a range of new capabilities and services far beyond today\u2019s offerings, which will radically change the lifestyles of future human generation. In recent years, Internet has become increasingly pervasive. Besides allowing people to connect anytime and everywhere to achieve pervasiveness and allow mobility, the Internet is evolving into the communication medium for objects that are embedded in the real world. The coupling among mobile technology, embedded smart objects and a worldwide pervasive communication infrastructure constitutes the Mobile and Pervasive Internet of Things. The mobile and pervasive IoT enables a detailed characterization of the real physical applications, as well as a rich set of pervasive interactions with the physical world. As such, it has the potential to revolutionize future pervasive applications and influence the real world entities to achieve better quality of life for future generation of mankind. We invite original research contributions that advance the state of the art posing a new direction or present a controversial point of view. PerIoT will be held in conjunction with IEEE PerCom 2017.\n\n\nThis workshop (PerIoT) solicits high-quality papers presenting original research results on the overlapping area of IoT applications facilitating the vision of mobile and pervasive computing. We aim to focus on general research problems arising from the pervasive interaction and communication of mobile and IoT devices in physical world. Some of these research challenges may include: conflicting standards, suitable networks protocols, bandwidth scarcity, device fragmentation (servers to TVs, phones to sensors), content organization, security, data privacy, testing automation and etc.  Thus, the aim of this workshop is to bring together practitioners and researchers from both academia and industry in order to have a forum for discussion and technical presentations on the recent advances in the area of mobile and pervasive IoT. It furthermore serves as a forum for the research community to discuss open issues, novel solutions and the future development of mobile and pervasive IoT applications.\n\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nSystem architectures for IoT targeted to pervasive scenarios and mobile applications\n\n\nMiddleware and platforms for IoT based mobile and pervasive applications\n\n\nSecurity and privacy in mobile and pervasive IoT scenarios\n\n\nInteroperability of protocols for IoT, mobile and pervasive systems\n\n\nContext awareness in the mobile and pervasive IoT\n\n\nMobility management in the communication protocols of pervasive IoT\n\n\nExperiences in building mobile and pervasive IoT platforms\n\n\nMobile and pervasive applications built on top of IoT\n\n\nEnabling technologies and standards for IoT\n\n\nRouting protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) in IoT\n\n\nPower consumption and optimization in IoT\n\n\nIoT platforms for BigData and Data analytics on mobile and pervasive environments\n\n\nFault-tolerance and reliability in mobile and pervasive IoT applications\n\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\nPapers submission deadline: \nNovember 11, 2016\n\n  November 18, 2016\n \n\n  Author notification due: \nDecember 23, 2016\n \n\n  Camera ready deadline: \nJanuary 13, 2017 (FIRM)\n \n\n  Author registration deadline: \nJanuary 13, 2017 (FIRM)\n \n\n  Workshop date: To be announced soon (March 13-17, 2017)\n\n\nCall for Papers (CFP)\n\n\nLink\n\n\nSubmission and Registration\n\n\nAuthors are invited to submit regular (full) papers for presentation at the workshop, describing original, previously unpublished work, which is not currently under review by another workshop, conference, or journal. Regular papers should present novel perspectives within the general scope of the workshop.\n\n\nPerIoT is \nsingle-blind\n. Papers may be no more than \n6 pages\n in length. Papers in excess of page limits shall not be considered for review or publication. All papers must be typeset in double-column IEEE format using 10pt fonts on US letter paper, with all fonts embedded. The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the IEEE Computer Society website. Submissions must be made via \nEDAS\n.\n\n\nIt is a requirement that all authors listed in the submitted paper are also listed in EDAS. The author section of EDAS will be locked after the workshop submission deadline to ensure that conflict-of-interest can be properly enforced during review. If the list of authors differs between the paper and EDAS, the paper may not be reviewed. The authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered at full rate for that paper to appear in the proceedings and to be scheduled for presentation.\n\n\nEach accepted paper will require a full PERCOM conference registration (no registration is available for workshops only).\n\n\nSubmission link: \nhttps://edas.info/N22899\n\n\nOrganizers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarzana Rahman\n\nJames Madison University\n\nEmail: rahma2fx@jmu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndadul Hoque\n\nNortheastern University\n\nEmail: mhoque@purdue.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Program Committee\n\n\n\n\nAyan Banerjee, Arizona State University\n\n\nZakirul Alam Bhuiyan, Fordham University\n\n\nFahim Kawser, HP Labs\n\n\nBrahim Medjahed, University of Michigan Dearborn\n\n\nShahriar Nirjon, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\n\nAnne Ngu, Texas State University\n\n\nJamie Payton, University of North Carolina-Charlotte\n\n\nMichael Sheng, University of Adelaide\n\n\nWenbo Shi, Harvard University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublicity Chair\n\n\n\n\nSamy El-Tawab\n\nJames Madison University\n\nEmail: eltawass@jmu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop Program\n\n\nTBA\n\n\nHotel and Venue Information\n\n\nInformation",
